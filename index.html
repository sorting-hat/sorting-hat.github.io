			<h1>Hogwarts House Sorting Quiz<hr></h1>

			<img src="http://project-nerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Hogwarts-Banner.jpg" style="width:200px; height:212px; margin-left:10pt; float:right;" title="Hogwarts Seal">

			<p align="justify">I know what you're all thinking, "Not -another- sorting quiz!", but before you get bored and leave, let me say a few things about it. 
			This is not the ordinary sorting quiz that you're used to. Unlike all those other quizzes infesting the Internet, this quiz actually sorts you for who 
			you are as a person, not because your favorite animal is a lion.</p>

			<p align="justify">I made this quiz as a reaction to all the bad sorting quizzes. The problem with most of the existing quizzes, is that the questions 
			rarely have anything to do with which house you would actually be sorted into. Your favorite color doesn't effect which house you belong to. Not every 
			Gryffindor likes defense against the dark arts, not every Slytherin likes potions. Just look at Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Each is in Gryffindor, but 
			each has a completely different disposition. Harry's father was often a bully and a thief, yet he was still in Gryffindor.</p>

			<p align="justify">This quiz will actually ask you psychological questions with a variety of answers that can't easily be determined as to which house 
			they fit into. This was meant to be more like what the Sorting Hat does. Just remember though that you must answer these questions truthfully in order 
			to get an accurate answer.</p>

			<p align="justify">Also these questions are written to take place in our world, not the world of Harry Potter. I didn't give a Harry Potter theme to the 
			quiz because the answers are more accurate this way. As Muggles, we don't have any idea what it's like to be faced with a troll or a bogart and we've 
			never played quiddich. Our answers may be skewed as to how our favorite characters would act instead of ourselves. However, we all know what it's like 
			to live in the Muggle world because we do it every day.</p>

			<p align="justify">So anyway, without further ado.</p>
